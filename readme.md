# Restaurant Menu API (RMA)

## Overview
The **Restaurant Menu API (RMA)** is a GraphQL-based API that provides menu data for various categories such as appetizers, entrees, sandwiches, salads, and tacos. It is built using **Apollo Server** with **Express.js** and can be easily tested using **Jest**.

This project allows users to query for menu data with GraphQL, and the responses include details such as the name, description, and price of each item.
